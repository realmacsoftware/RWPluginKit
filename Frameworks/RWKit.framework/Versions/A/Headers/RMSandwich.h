/// An in-memory representation of a sandwich filling.
/** A Sandwich Filling is the central entity of the Sandwich file format: it is responsible for preserving the user's data.  To do this, you can store three types of data in a sandwich filling: (1) an arbitrary NSDictionary, (2) files, (3) more sandwiches.  The intended use is for the NSDictionary to store small bits of information that would be inefficient to store in a file, due to inefficiency issues with lots of small files.  While files can be very large, they are multiply hard-linked as much as possible for maximum efficiency.  (This is particularly useful in conjunction with the RMPagedObject class; see that class's documentation for more information.)  Currently, files are required to be normal files or directories and cannot be e.g. a symlink, or special character device.  Subsandwiches are simply stored as subdirectories. */

/// An object to manipulate sandwiches (an on-disk file format).
/** A sandwich is a directory (a.k.a. bundle) on disk with a particular
  * structure.  It only stores three bits of information: a 'Type' string that
  * indicates what type of document it is; an optional 'Creator' string that
  * indicates what application created the sandwich, and an array of
  * 'Sandwich Fillings'.  The real meat of a sandwich (pardon the pun) is
  * really in the Sandwich Fillings, which may actually contain more sandwiches
  * (stored in subdirectories of the root sandwich directory); see the
  * RMSandwichFilling class for more information about them.
  * 
  * Sandwich Fillings have a very simple versioning scheme, with each version
  * number simply determined from its index in the array.  This implies that
  * the versions must start at 0 and increase in an integral manner, so that
  * version 4 cannot exist without versions 0, 1, 2 and 3 also existing.
  * Applications are expected to be able to understand up to a particular
  * version number, so if an application only understands up to version 2,
  * version numbers 3 and 4 will not affect its operation.  Backward
  * compatibility is achieved by simply reading in version numbers that you
  * understand, and ignoring higher version numbers.  Forward compatibility is
  * achieved by saving the sandwich fillings in those higher versions in a
  * temporary store, and then re-including those higher-numbered versions in
  * the final sandwich that's saved back to disk.
  *
  * Sandwiches store their information (type, creator, sandwich fillings) in
  * an Apple Property List file named Contents.plist in the directory.  (See
  * the plist(5) manpage for more information about property list files.)
  * The Contents.plist file is usually saved as an XML plist for maximum
  * interoperability and robustness against corruption, but this can be changed
  * by the programmer to e.g. a binary plist file if the sandwich filling data
  * is not critical (e.g. cache data).
  *
  * Other than the Contents.plist file, other files and directories may (and
  * often will) be present in the directory; these files will usually be
  * referenced by the sandwich fillings.
  *
  * Note that while a sandwich implements the NSCopying protocol, a sandwich
  * copy will still reference the same files on disk; the disk files will not
  * normally be copied.  This is what you probably want for normal behaviour,
  * otherwise referencing a sandwich inside e.g. an NSDictionary will end up
  * copying all the on-disk files as well, which is relatively expensive.
  * However, if you want to make a copy of the sandwich and its entire
  * directory structure on disk, use the -copyDuplicatingFiles method, which
  * will copy the entire sandwich directory structure to a temporary directory.
  * The temporary directory will be deleted on application exit (via
  * the NSApplicationWillTerminateNotification notification name), so you must
  * re-save the sandwich to disk manually if you wish to preserve the copied
  * data.  Note that when you load a document, you should invoke
  * -copyDuplicatingFiles to preserve the sandwich's contents, otherwise the
  * user will probably be rather surprised when he deletes the sandwich
  * directory after loading the file and finds out that things are missing.
