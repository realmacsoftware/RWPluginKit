/// A proxy class for an object that's serialised to disk, and is deserialised into memory on demand as needed.
/** A "paged object" is an abstract class that serialises and de-serialises its container objects to disk, to keep heap memory usage low.  It is intended to be used with potentially huge objects (e.g. 50MB+) where the working set deals with very few of these huge objects at a time and does not require that all of them reside in memory at once.  Any objects that are not required in-memory memory are "paged" out (i.e. serialised to disk) whenever their reference count drops to zero; however, since the RMPagedObject class for that object is still around, you can easily re-access that object using the object property as usual, and the RMPagedObject will de-serialise that object from disk back into memory.  When a paged object is copied, the on-disk backing store will also be duplicated.  A paged object can also be "cached" in memory for efficient access to the object, which is very useful if the vast majority of paged objects are small but a few extremely large ones need to be paged out to disk.  A subclass can determine whether to cache the object by overriding the +shouldCacheObject: method.
  * 
  * This class is an abstract class: it leaves the actual serialisation of objects to disk to concrete subclasses.  The two standard subclasses you'll probably use are RMArchivedObject, which uses the NSCoding protocol to save and load objects, and RMFrozenObject, which uses the RMFreezing and RMThawing protocols to save and load objets.  If you are implementing a concrete subclass of RMPagedObject, override the -readObjectFromPath: and -writeObject:toPath:error: methods to load and save the object from/to disk, respectively.  You should also provide your own (typed) accessor methods in your subclass; e.g. if you are using this to store an NSImage*, subclass this as a new PagedImage class, and implement your own properties that set and return NSImages.  It is also recommended that you override the +preferredExtension method to give your on-disk representations a particular file extension.  You may also override the -setup method to perform any extra initialisation there.  For an example concrete subclass of RMPagedObject, see the RMFrozenString class (which is in a subclass of RMFrozenObject).
  *
  * Note that the paged object may not be deleted when the application terminates; in particular, a paged object's backing store on disk will not be deleted if the application crashes.  This is intentional, since expert users can then peek around in the paged objects' temporary directory to examine any data.  If you really need to make sure that all your files are deleted when the process exits, it's strongly suggested that you track the paths yourself and use atexit() or a similar handler to register a cleanup function.
  *
  * Also note that if you are loading data from a user's document, the user may delete that document while your application is running, and the user probably expects that the application still has their data!  It's strongly suggested that you use the idiom of "RMPagedObject* myLoadedObject = [[RMPagedObject pagedObjectWithPath:myPath deleteOnDisposal:NO] copy]" if you are loading a user's document data.  This will use a separate disk backing store in a temporary file, so that if the user deletes their document while the application is running, the paged object's data will still be available.
