    New plugin API methods. We're moving to NSViewControllers, which means you'll receive more notifications about when your views are on screen.
    The below methods have been marked as optional, but it would make sense in most cases to return an NSViewController subclass from at least
    one of them.
    If your plugin does not implement -editingViewController, you will not appear in the page list.

/// If implemented, should return a view controller to be placed into the left side of the document window
