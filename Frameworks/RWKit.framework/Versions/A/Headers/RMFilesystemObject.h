/// A class that represents a particular file on disk -- the file on disk is copied and deleted as this object is copied and deleted.
/** This class is used to manage files and directories on disk.  By "manage", this class effectively takes ownership of the file or directory at the given path: when this object is copied, it will likewise make a duplicate of the file or directory on disk in a temporary directory.  When this object is no longer referenced, it can also optionally delete the file or directory on disk.  While this seems like a rather lightweight class, it is incredibly useful when one has to work with files as a temporary store: files and directories can then be represented as standard objects, and are copied and deleted automatically.
  *
  * Files and directories are also normally deleted on standard application termination (i.e. when an NSApplicationWillTerminateNotification is received).  However, the file or directory is not always deleted when the application terminates; in particular, it will not be deleted if the application crashes.  This is intentional, since expert users can then peek around in the system's temporary directory to examine any data.  If you really need to make sure that all your disk objects are deleted when the process exits, it's strongly suggested that you track the paths yourself and use atexit() or a similar handler to register a cleanup function.
 *
 * Copies made of this object (via -copy and -copyWithZone:) will make a copy of the referenced file or directory in a temporary directory, and will be automatically deleted when the copied object is no longer referenced.  To change this behaviour for the copied object, you must manually set the deleteOnDisposal property to NO after copying it.
 *
 * Also note that if you are using this class to load data from a user's document, the user may delete that document while your application is running, and the user probably expects that the application still has their data if this happens!  It's strongly suggested that you use the idiom of "RMFilesystemObject* myObject = [[RMFilesystemObject filesystemObjectWithPath:myPath deleteOnDisposal:NO] copy]" if you are loading a user's document data.  This will create a new temporary file from the original data, so that if the user deletes their document while the application is running, the filesystem's object's path will still be available.
